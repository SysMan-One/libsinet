This is libsinet, lightweight userland implementation of the UDP/IPv4 stack
designed to plug into the netmap framework.

Some of the desing objectives for this code:
 - multithread-safe, multithread-optimized
 - provably small CPU run-time overhead
 - high-PPS optimized
 - as close as socket(2) API as possible
 - UDP/layerII initially, TCP in mind
